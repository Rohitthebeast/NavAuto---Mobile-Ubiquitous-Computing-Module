# NavAuto---Mobile-Ubiquitous-Computing-Module

In our today's world there have been challenges faced by Users which includes wasted time and stress trying to find their parked cars in packed or unfamiliar regions, which may be inconvenient and stressful. There also have been concerns about theft or illegal use of their vehicles which later on creates anxiety and security challenges for users. 
To prevent this hardship, I have tried integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) solution of Location Beacons for Vehicle Tracking where users can remotely access their car's location, receive instant alerts, and optimize fleet management, enhancing security and efficiency. This solution changes automobile location by using the power of the Internet of Things, providing the highest level of simplicity and security. 
These are small, discreet devices installed in automobiles that aid in location and tracking through the use of the NavAuto application. A single beacon would be affixed to each vehicle, enabling users to easily identify and track their vehicles in real time. To give users exact location information, the NavAuto app would receive the signals generated by the beacons and use that information. By serving as internal vehicle IDs in the tracking system, these position beacons provide simple and efficient automotive location.
